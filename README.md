# Calendar Event App

A React-based calendar event management app that displays events for the current month. Users can drag and drop events onto different days, and the event descriptions appear when hovered over.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Event Management**: Allows users to drag events and drop them onto different days.
- **Event Description on Hover**: Hover over an event to view its detailed description.
- **Event Importance Styling**: Events are visually styled based on their importance (`personal`, `work`, `other`).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Context-Driven Data**: Uses React Context API to manage and share event data across components.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Events are saved to **LocalStorage**, allowing users to persist event data even after refreshing the page or reopening the app.
